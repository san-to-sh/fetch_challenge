- `fetch_rewards_data_model.pdf`: Contains the data model and Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram necessary for understanding the structure of the database and relationships between different data entities.
- `data quality.zip`: A compressed file containing reports on data quality checks. 
- `Fetch_challenge_Email_Slack_Message.docx`: Contains stakeholder communication email/Slack message

## How to Use

1. **Data Exploration and Analysis**:
   - Start with `Fetch_challenge.ipynb` for a guided journey through data cleaning, exploration, and analysis. This notebook provides detailed instructions and code for processing the datasets and deriving insights.

2. **Understanding the Data Model**:
   - Open `fetch_rewards_data_model.pdf` to familiarize yourself with the data model and ER diagram. This will help in understanding how data is structured and how different tables relate to each other.

3. **Data Quality Checks**:
   - Extract `data quality.zip` to review the data quality check reports. These reports are essential for assessing the datasets' usability and trustworthiness.

4. **Stakeholder Communication**:
